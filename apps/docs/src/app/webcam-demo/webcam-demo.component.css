/* Styles for webcam-demo.component.css - Rely primarily on Tailwind CSS classes in the HTML. */
/* Add any component-specific custom styles here if they cannot be achieved with Tailwind. */

/* Example of using @apply for a custom utility, if needed: */
/* .custom-text-style {
  @apply text-lg font-semibold text-purple-700;
} */

/* Most styles from the previous CSS file have been removed as they are now handled by Tailwind utility classes
   in the webcam-demo.component.html file. This includes:
   - .status-badge and its variants (handled by ngClass with Tailwind bg/text colors and other utilities)
   - .video-container and video (handled by aspect-video, bg-black, rounded-lg, object-contain, etc.)
   - .card, .card-body (handled by bg-white, rounded-xl, shadow-lg, p-4, etc.)
   - .form-group, .form-label, .form-control (handled by block, font-medium, mb-1, border, rounded, focus:ring, etc.)
   - .btn and its variants (handled by px-4, py-2, bg-blue-600, text-white, rounded, hover:bg-blue-700, etc.)
   - .alert and .alert-danger (handled by bg-red-50, border, text-red-700, etc.)
   - .table and its sub-styles (handled by min-w-full, text-sm, bg-gray-100, px-3, py-2, etc.)
   - pre and code (handled by bg-gray-100, rounded, p-3, text-xs, etc. in the HTML)
   - Responsive utilities like .d-flex, .gap-2, .mb-3, .table-responsive (handled by Tailwind's flex, gap, m, and overflow utilities)
   - Media queries for responsive adjustments (handled by Tailwind's responsive prefixes like md:, sm:)
